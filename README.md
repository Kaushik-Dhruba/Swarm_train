# 🐝 Decentralized Actor-Centralized Critic Swarm Training

This project implements a swarm simulation environment where multiple agents learn to collaborate using decentralized actor and centralized critic reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal is to **compare multiple training methods** and evaluate which yields better swarm coordination and task performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Swarm Environment:** Simulated 2D environment where agents cooperate to complete tasks (e.g., pushing objects).
- **Training Paradigm:** Decentralized actor policies with a centralized critic for improved learning stability.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Test and compare different RL algorithms and training setups.
- **Visualization:** Periodic GIF generation visualizing agent behaviors and swarm dynamics.
