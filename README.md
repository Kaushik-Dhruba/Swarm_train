# 🐝 Multi-Agent Swarm Training

This project implements a swarm simulation environment where multiple agents learn to collaborate using decentralized actor and centralized critic reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal is to compare multiple training methods and evaluate which yields better swarm coordination and task performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Swarm Environment:** Simulated 2D environment where agents cooperate to complete tasks (e.g., pushing objects).
- **Training Paradigm:** Decentralized actor policies with a centralized critic for improved learning stability.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Test and compare different RL algorithms and training setups.
- **Visualization:** Periodic GIF generation visualizing agent behaviors and swarm dynamics.
